## Description

This week my assignment was to create a budget tracker.
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:
- Enter deposits offline
- Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:
- Offline entries should be added to tracker.

## The screenshot of the application is presented below
